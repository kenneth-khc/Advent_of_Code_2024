# Advent of Code 2024
-------
This is my first time participating in Advent of Code, due to incentives given by my campus. 
I took the opportunity to learn C++, with the ambitious goal of hitting 50 stars, without knowing how hard some of the later days can be.
With a fundamental lack of knowledge in many complex data structures and algorithms, some of the puzzles were simply too overwhelming and I don't even know where to start.
For now, I'm satisfied with 42 stars as the event ended and most importantly, I've been exposed to many new algorithms and I've gained better grasp of C++.
Hopefully I eventually come back and update my solutions as well as completing the remaining the puzzles for this year.
Another grand and ambitious goal would be getting all 50 stars for every year's Advent of Code, one day...
